# Ingest Worker Runbook — Narralytica

This runbook describes how to **operate, debug, and rerun** the ingest worker safely.

Use this guide when ingestion jobs fail, stall, or need to be reprocessed.

---

## 🎯 When to Use This Runbook

Use this runbook if:

- A video ingestion job is stuck
- A download failed
- Audio extraction failed
- Metadata looks incorrect
- Media files are missing from storage
- A backfill requires re-ingesting videos

---

## 🔍 Step 1 — Identify the Job

1. Find the job ID via:
   - Admin Console
   - API `/jobs` endpoint
   - Logs or alerts

2. Check job status in the database:
   - `pending`
   - `running`
   - `failed`
   - `completed`

---

## 🪵 Step 2 — Inspect Logs

Check worker logs for:

- Download errors (timeouts, 403, platform blocks)
- Storage upload failures
- Audio extraction errors (ffmpeg issues)
- File corruption or incomplete downloads

Logs should include the job ID for tracing.

---

## 📦 Step 3 — Verify Artifacts

Confirm the following exist in object storage:

| Artifact | Expected? |
|----------|-----------|
| Original video file | Yes |
| Extracted audio file | Yes |
| Metadata record in DB | Yes |

If artifacts are missing, ingestion did not complete properly.

---

## 🔁 Step 4 — Retry the Job

Before retrying, confirm:

- No duplicate media already stored
- Previous partial files can be safely overwritten

Retry methods:

- Use Admin Console "Retry Job"
- Re-submit ingestion request via API
- Manually reset job status (only if documented and safe)

The ingest worker must be idempotent.

---

## 🧼 Step 5 — Clean Up Corrupt Artifacts

If a job left corrupted or partial files:

1. Remove broken artifacts from object storage
2. Reset job status to allow reprocessing
3. Document cleanup in incident log if production

Never delete valid media without confirmation.

## ⚠️ Common Failure Causes

| Issue | Cause |
|------|------|
| Video download blocked | Platform restrictions |
| Timeout during download | Network instability |
| Audio extraction failure | Corrupt or unsupported codec |
| Storage upload error | Credentials or network issue |

---

## 🛑 When to Escalate

Escalate if:

- Multiple jobs fail with the same source
- Storage system is unavailable
- Worker crashes repeatedly
- Corruption appears systemic

Follow incident procedures in:

- `docs/runbooks/incident.md`

## Ingestion Phase Ownership

The **ingest worker** is responsible for updating `ingestion_phase`.

The orchestrator only manages the global job `status`.

### Phase Updates

| Phase | status | ingestion_phase |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Start processing | running | downloading |
| Audio extraction | running | processing |
| Persisting artifacts | running | storing |
| Success | succeeded | null |
| Failure | failed | null |

This separation ensures:
- Orchestrator remains generic
- Worker owns execution details
- Database reflects real execution state
