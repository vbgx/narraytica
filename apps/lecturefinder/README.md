# LectureFinder — Narralytica

LectureFinder is a platform for discovering the **best video explanations of any concept**.

It helps learners, students, and curious minds find **clear, concise teaching moments** hidden inside long talks, lectures, and educational videos.

Instead of searching entire videos, LectureFinder points directly to **the exact segment where something is explained well**.
